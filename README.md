Planning and Execution of Hospital Network

Project Overview

This project aims to develop and implement a robust network infrastructure to provide reliable internet connectivity to the main hospital in the remote uThukela District of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. The hospital serves a wide range of patients and requires consistent access to the internet to support medical, administrative, and supply chain operations. By implementing a sustainable network extension from an existing connection, this project addresses the digital divide in a crucial area and enhances healthcare delivery capabilities.
